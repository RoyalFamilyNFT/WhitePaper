<b>"Short WhitePaper"</b> of Royal Family NFTs

<h3><b>• What is the "RoyalFamilyNFT"?</b></h3>

1. The NFTs of the royal family consist of 10 rooms
2. Each room has 10 independent characters + GOD
3. GOD's character is like a coach
4. All 10 characters own a room, the room does not belong to one person
5. Characters can not change their room (Because every room is valued, each room has its own value)
6. The value of each room is recognizable by the "name" - "number" - "characters" of that room
  - The most valuable room is number 1, Diamond room with the presence of 10 kings or queens.
 
<h3><b>• What happens in the rooms?</b></h3>

1. Private meetings are held between 10 characters in the room
2. The character of GOD is present in all meetings 
3. All 10 characters can:
  - Talk to each other
  - Make decisions
  - Consult together
  - Start activities

<h3><b>• When do rooms become active?</b></h3>
